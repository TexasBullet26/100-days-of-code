  - Made a repository called `speedstudy-progress` which has everything that I plan on learning this year and will have the notes for everything I finish. This repository is directly related to `p1xt/speedstudy` and `p1xt/p1xt-progress`.
    - [My speedstudy-progress repository](https://github.com/TexasBullet26/speedstudy-progress)
  - I read this article on [The State of JavaScript 2017](https://stateofjs.com/2017/introduction/) which I recommend reading.
  - I also decided to download and set-up Visual Studio Code to see if I like it better than Atom. I'm not quite sure yet..

  - Pushed this to a newly created repository [LearnPython](https://github.com/TexasBullet26/LearnPython)

### R1D3

*Next.js Tutorial (learnnext)*

[hello-next repository](https://github.com/TexasBullet26/hello-next)
  - Started tutorial for Next.js (Step 1.)
    - Created directory `hello-next`
    - `git init` to initialize repository
    - `npm init -y` to create a `package.json`
    - Instead of `npm install --save react react-dom next` I ran `yarn add react react-dom next`
      - This created a `yarn.lock` file that I commited to the repository.
    - Created a `.gitignore` and `README.md` for the project.
    - Created a file `pages/index.js` and added in scripts in `package.json`: `"dev": "next"`.
      - This makes it possible to run `yarn dev` which adds HMR to the project at `localhost://3000`.
  - End Step 1
