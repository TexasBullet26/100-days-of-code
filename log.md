# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 04, 2018 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**:
  - One Object-Oriented JavaScript freeCodeCamp Solution (Pushed to GitHub).
  - Made a repository called `speedstudy-progress` which has everything that I plan on learning this year and will have the notes for everything I finish. This repository is directly related to `p1xt/speedstudy` and `p1xt/p1xt-progress`.
  - I read this article on [The State of JavaScript 2017](https://stateofjs.com/2017/introduction/) which I recommend reading.
  - I also decided to download and set-up Visual Studio Code to see if I like it better than Atom. I'm not quite sure yet..

**Thoughts**:
This `speedstudy-progress` is going to be a challenge, but I love to learn so it'll be a lot of fun. I'm using a lot of resources from the p1xt-guides CS-WD so I will hopefully be able to put a dent into that as well. I also just signed-up for the Chingu Voyage-4 coming up in February. I'm hoping that I get in.

**Link(s) to work**:

  - I also have a repository for my freeCodeCamp solutions, here is the one I did today [Declare JavaScript Objects as Variables](https://github.com/TexasBullet26/fcc-progress/tree/master/src/00-front-end-development/05-object-oriented-and-functional-programming/00-declare-javascript-objects-and-variables)
