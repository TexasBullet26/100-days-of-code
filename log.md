# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 17, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Read some of YDKJS - up & going chapter 1 and took notes. | Worked on some of freeCodeCamp's Beta Basic JavaScript curriculum. 

**Thoughts**: I've been trying to learn too much, so I've decided to go back to the basics of those two resources to start off. I'm participating in 100-days-of-code to help keep myself accountable.
